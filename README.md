## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I found it a bit challenging to implement BoardController.swift, but after reviewing week 1's activity and troubleshooting, I was able to get it working as expected.

## Notes

I struggled with restricting the number of maximum guesses to 7 (preventing 'numTimesGuessed' from exceeding the limit). However, through multiple logic adjustments and debugging, I was able to fix the error.
